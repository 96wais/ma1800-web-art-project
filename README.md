Echoes of Space - Project

Introduction:
This is my project where i showcase about the solar system, featuring facts about the solar system, planets such as mercury, saturn and neptune. the project uses 100% of HTML and CSS coding languages tocreate a themed multi page website.

Features:
There are many feautures within the project that I used. i used 4 HTML pages including 3 planet pages, It includes a navigation bar linking all the pages together which i found quite difficult to do. i shared the CSS file for consistent design. i added many GIF's and images to add some extra flare to the website. I also added some extra feautures such as in built stars and glowing features which i also found very difficult. 
Each page was made by using HTML and connected them with a navigation bar. I also added the style.css to control the colours, the layouts and the backround. The stars are also added by coding them in CSS which was quite difficult for me. I did this by using radial gradients. As well as this, i also added some gifs and images to make each page more visually interesting. On top of this, I also added some audio to the pages which makes it more interesting and to me, if feels like i am visually in space.

Challenges:
As this was my first project alone, with no help with teachers, and no coding experience before i started this course. I found this quite difficult, but i happily i got through this. my challenge started off by mixing up my coding langauges with the 2 coding modules which gave me only 2 weeks left to do the project. I happily got through the project with staying up late do to this project. It may not be the best but i happily got through it with things i thought i could never do. i learned may stuff such as how to debug HTML and CSS pages. I normally gget help from my professors but i done this alone by scanning my code and seeing small stuff that would break my code such as GIFS/images not working or even smaller things that would lead the whole page being broken such as missing a bracket. overall, as a person who had never had coding experience. i really face a lot of challenges are there were stuff i wanted to add but they were way to challenging but i hope that i can be a good coder in the future.
Overall, i did learn alot of stuff such as creating a whole webiste on my own and/structure a basic multi-page website on my own and it was quite hard and challenging.

i Also used some case studies to help with my project would be Art Meets Radical Openness (2020 -  Lost in the Garden of Clouds). The reason why i picked this case study is because it has the idea of clouds and space which i really enjoyes. As well as this, i also looked at the colour and it matches very well. The sky is blue and the person used a blue colour for the webiste. Mine is about space any my main colours were light blue and yellow as there are many colours in space such as planets and stars. I also really liked the idea of information as it has a lot of writing and i enjoy writing. I also liked the idea of JODI 1996. The project just astonishes me and i really liked it. My space and astronomy idea came from JODI 1996

I also used lots of GIFS and Audios as it made the project look really good
